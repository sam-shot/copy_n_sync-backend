# Copy-n-Sync
Welcome to Copy-n-Sync, a project that I created to make my life easier. Have you ever had a file that you wanted to keep synced across multiple devices? Yeah, me too. That's why I made this thing.

## How it works
Copy-n-Sync uses the power of Rive animations to display a cute little cat that helps you keep your files in sync. You simply upload a file to the server, and the cat will make sure that it's available on all your devices. It's like having a personal assistant, but without the attitude.

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing to this project, I'd be more than happy to have your help. Just send me a message on Twitter at ()[] and let me know what you'd like to do. I'm always looking for new ideas and suggestions.

## Installation
To get started with Copy-n-Sync, simply clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies


Once you've done that, you can start the server by running;
npm start
And that's it! You should be up and running with your very own copy-syncing cat in no time.
