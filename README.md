# Copy-n-Sync
Welcome to Copy-n-Sync, a project that I created to make my life easier. Have you ever had a link or text that you wanted to keep synced across multiple devices? Yeah, me too. That's why I made this thing.

## How it works
Copy-n-sync uses the power of socket.io to send texts and links over devices in real-time.
